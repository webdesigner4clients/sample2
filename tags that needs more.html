 <h1> Special tags that need "More" </h1>
 <h2> Button </h2>
     <p> Here is the example of button tag .it is little bit misleading since it is button that does not do anything. you would want to add some interactivity
, perhaps with java script </p>
<button> open </button><br>
<button> close </button> <br>
<hr>
<h2> Meter </h2>
<p> the meter tag is cool and can take a lot of attributes. But again itb is better if you have some code that can make the attribute value
dynamic instead of "hardcoding" them. when you think meter , think of a final score for test.</p>
<meter min="0"x="100" value="50">50%</meter><br>
<meter min="0" max="1" value=".25">25%</meter><br>
<meter min="5" max="10" value="8">60%</meter><br>
<hr>
<h2> Iframe </h2>
<p> frame used to nest content. It is not supported equally by all browsers. you will want to explore settind many of the different options such as height and width.

<p> bdo stan ds for bidirectional override. this tag can be used to change the direction of the text. </p>
<p> this tag will go left to right </p>
<p><bdo dir="rtl"> this text will go left to right.</bdo></p>
